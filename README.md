# Overview
It is designed to record the name, category and state of the task, and also record the users' names and time created.
# How to run
It could be ran by steamlit throuth VScode terminal
# Lesson learned:
Repeating install steamlit is possible to lead crush with terminal to run the code, and the output is hard to identify it. Using pip list command is a very good lesson. Besides, I should not forget to get a right form of time, which will result errors shown in output. Finally, the sum of cols is needed to be modified, which is easily to be ignored.
# Improvemnt
It is still possible to input wrong category that not one of the three options. (School and so on), so it should be set as a class and limit the options of input.
